### Project Summary ###

The goal of this project is to implement the game <i>Ghost</i> as a native Android application.

### Features ###

* The game is interactive: two players take turns in adding a letter to the word.
* The game allows the players to select their name from a list of all previously used names.
* The game supports a choice of dictionary: either Dutch or English.
* During game play, the players are allowed to restart the game, change the language setting (i.e., choice of dictionary), and change their names.
* The language preference (i.e., choice of dictionary) survives if the players quit and re-open the application (a default language is chosen if no preference is set).
* The game's state survives if the players quit the application or other activities appear above it; players can return to the game and continue playing where they left off, even if the application is quit or the device is turned off.
* The game supports local highscores.
