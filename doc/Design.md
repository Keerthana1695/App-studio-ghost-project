##### Design Document Version: 1.0 #####

This design document captions any and all design decision that I have made before implementing the Ghost application. This document builds on the sketches and information provided in the README (../README.md), so please check out that file first.

<b>Note</b>: This design document will display many similarites with the README file. However, besides sketches of each screen, this document will also capture the relations between the screens (activities/controllers, classes, methods, etc.). 

### Controllers/Activities with menu items ###

The hand-drawn sketches below are adopted from the README. Each hand-drawn sketch depicts a 'screen' in the application. The name above each sketch is the name of the cotroller/activity that will manage the screen.
